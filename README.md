As part of my studies in the fifth semester at the Beuth University of Applied Sciences four classmates and I developed our biggest project called Battle Arena with the game engine Unity in C#. It was also our very first time to work with the Unity Engine and C# and we really loved it.
<br/><br/>
We had eleven weeks for the developing.

What can I say about Battle Arena?<br/>
Well, the team and I are really proud of our project because it was the first time we built and coordinated a team. Finding out the strenghts and weaknesses of each member and to share out tasks was a challenge but we tried and we did it and we did good. Each member of the team had a specific task and each member did an outstanding and very good job. Of course, we also sometimes had situations where we discussed very rough (in a very constructive way) but we always had the focus what would benefit the game. For us as a team it was very important that every team member has a voice and anybody can criticise anybody else's work if it's necessary.
<br/><br/>
Battle Arena is a story driven game with a turn-based combat system. You play as a warrior who got sucked into a battle arena fighting against enemies - in the end you have to defeat the Death to free yourself. Experience realistic characters that are filmed and digitized using the blue screen technique.
<br/><br/>
Our focus was to develop everything ourselves - like background and combat music, sound effects, voice acting, acting, graphics, animations,... just everything!
<br/><br/>
For game testing, we invited friends and family to play and test the game.
